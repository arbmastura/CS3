				<h3>MAIN STAGES OF FOOD PROCESSING</h3>
				<h4>Ingestion</h4>
					<p>Is the act of eating.</p>
				<h4>Digestion</h4>
					<p>The process of breaking down food</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Mechanical digestion is that of physically tearing food into small pieces to allow more surface area for enzymes and chemicals.</li>
						<li>Chemical digestion is that of chemically breaking down food for cell use.</p>
					</ul>
					<p>Food break down is essential because cells can absorb smaller particles; it allows better compatibility with animal needs for cell and tissue function.</p>
				<h4>Absorption</h4>
					<p>Food molecules, broken down, are absorbed by cells.</p>
				<h4>Elimination</h4>
					<p>Stage where waste products are expelled from the body.</p>

			<h2>Digestive Compartments in Animals</h2>

		<section>
			<article>
					<p>Food processing occurs in specialized inracellular or extracellular compartments. Food vacuoles are the simplest digestive compartment. Cell absorption of solid food is through phagocytosis, and liquid through pinocytosis.</p>
					<p>Extracellular digestion is that of breaking down food in compartments continuous with a body's exterior.</p>
					<h3>GASTROVASCULAR CAVITY</h3> 
						<p>A digestive opening with one opening for food entrance and waste exit, as an incomplete digestive system. In contrast to the alimentary canal, it stores, but does not digest, food; it is larger with a singular opening.</p>
						<p>Digests food molecules (gastro); and distributes nutrients (vascular).</p>
					<h3>ALIMENTARY CANAL</h3>
						<p>Has two openings, the mouth and anus, respectively serving as the entrance and exit.</p>

			<h3>EARTHWORM</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The mouth is swallowed by the pharynx after entering through the mouth.</li>
					<li>The esophagus pushes the food to the crop for temporary storage.</li>
					<li>The gizzard, with small stones, mechanically digests the food.</li>
					<li>The intestines chemically digest the food with fluid from gland cells.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The typhlosole is an internal fold in the intestines to increase surface area for chemical digestions, as found in bivalve mollusks, lampreys, etc.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
		
			<article>
			<h3>GRASSHOPPER</h3>
				<h4>Foregut</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The mandibles are a singular pair in the mouth used to bite and chew food</li>
						<li>The maxillae are a double pair in the mouth used to manipulate and swallow food</li>
						<li>The pharynx swallows the food into the esophagus and into the crop for storage</li>
					</ul>
				<h4>Midgut</h4>
					<p>Contains the gastric caeca and stomach. It increases the surface area of the midgut to produce enzymes and absorb nutrients. The stomach consists of the proventriculus (storage) and the gizzard (digestion), the latter a second chewing stage.</p>
				<h4>Hindgut</h4>
					<p>Contains the intestines for nutrient absorption; excess water is absorbed by the rectum and the remaining waste passes through the anus.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>

			<article>
				<h3>BIRDS</h3>
					<p>The beak, esophagus, crop, and stomach, consisting of the proventriculus and gizzard, respectively for chemical and physical digestion; the intestines. Excretory and digestive waste is released through the cloaca.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
			
			<article>
				<h3>RUMINANTS</h3>
					<p>Ruminants possess a unique digestive system to absorb plant nutrients; the word originates from the Latin ruminare, meaning to "chew again." Can digest cellulose in cell walls, have four-chambered stomach, and cecum.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Saliva has enzymes to break down fat and starches; and buffers the pH</li>
						<li>The rumen, of the stomach, stores cud until regurgitation and reentry; contains microbes to break down cellulose, with papillae</li>
						<li>The recticulum contracts small particle to the omasum; and leaving larger particles in the rumen; filters through unwanted material</li>
						<li>The omasum is spherical with many tissue folds, absorbing water</li>
						<li>The abomasum is similar to monogastric stomachs: it secretes hydrochloric acid and receives enzymes from the pancreas; it is the last stomach chamber.</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Pseudoruminants</h4>
						<p>Have three stomach chambers, excluding the rumen, but instead having the cecum. Contains microorganisms to digest polysaccharides, with some examples being rabbits and camels.</p>

		<section class="content11">
			<img class="pic11" src="../images/caterpillar.jfif" alt="caterpillar" height="450px" width="750px">
			<article>
				<h4>Suspension Feeding</h4>
					<p>A feeding mechanism where food is consumed through small suspended particles in water, such as in whales.</p>
				<h4>Fluid Feeding</h4>
					<p>Food is extracted through sucking fluid from hosts, as in mosquitos.</p>
				<h4>Substrate Feeding</h4>
					<p>Animals live on food source, as in caterpillars.</p>
				<h4>Bulk Feeding</h4>
					<p>Animals eat large or bulk food, such as snakes.</p>

		<section class="content12">
			<img class="pic12" src="../images/fungi.jpg" alt="fungi" height="450px" width="750px">
			<article>
				<p>Fungi have the feeding stage (digestion) and the fruiting body stage (reproduction).</p>
				<h4>Feeding Stage</h4>
					<p>The mycelium branches underground to organisms for food; and exoenxymes from the hyphae are realeased to prey. Digestion precedes ingestion.</p>
				<h4>Honey Mushroom</h4>
					<p>The honey mushroom is larger than whales and elephants, and the oldest living organism on Earth, about 8,650 years old.</p>

					<p>Utilize sticky hairs or long tubes with hair to capture prey.</p>
				<h4>Active Trappers</h4>
					<p>Utilize rapid movement.</p>
