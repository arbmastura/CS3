			<h3>THE EUKARYOTES</h3>
			<img class="pic3" src="../images/cell.webp" alt="plant and animal cells" height="450px" width="750px">
				<article>
				<h4>Plasma Membrane</h4>
					<p>Additionally called "cell membrane," the plasma membrane is made of a semipermeable bilayer of lipids and proteins and serves as the entrance and exit.</p>
				<h4>Nucleus</h4>
					<p>The nucleus is the control center and controls cell activity. It is surrounded by a nuclear membrane and encloses DNA and genomes. It has a double-membrane nuclear envelope that separates the cytoplasm; and houses the nucleolus, which produces ribosomes.</p>
				<h4>Ribosomes</h4>
					<p>Ribosomes are composed of ribosomal RNA and are found in cytosol or bound to the endoplasmic recticulum; transported by the rough ER. The small and large ribosomes convert amino acids into proteins through protein synthesis.</p>
				<h4>Endoplasmic Recticulum</h4>
					<p>Part of the endomembrane system, composed of sacs and tubes for synthesis of membranes and metabolic processes.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Smooth ER
							<ul>
								<li>produces fats and breaks down toxins; no ribosomes</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Rough ER
							<ul>
								<li>transports proteins and synthesizes membranes; ribosomes are attached. Adds membrane protein and phospholids to membrane; transported by transport vesicles.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				<h4>Golgi Body</h4>
					<p>Known as the "warehouse of the cell," this receives, stores, modifies, stores, and ships products from the ER. It is a group of  stacked disc-like sacs of membrane structures. Near the ER and nucleus, it manufactures macromolecules and absorbs vesicles.</p>
				<h4>Vacuoles</h4>
					<p>Are large vesicles from ER and Golgi apparatus; its solution is not cytosol. Consists of food vacuoles, carrying food from phagocytosis; contractile, pumping surplus water such as in freswater protists; and central vacuoles in plants for water absorption and repository of inorganic ions.</p>
				<h4>Mitochondria</h4>
					<p>The powerhouse of the cell that creates adenosine triphosphate in the process of cellular respiration. The intermembrane space is the space between the inner and outer membrane. The mitochonrial matrix is surrounded by the inner membrane and holds DNA, ribosomes, and enzymes.</p>
				<h4>Lysosome</h4>
					<p>The lysosome is a membranous vesicle with hydrolytic enzymes and is involved in intracellular digestion. It breaks down food and kills pathogen. Autolysis is that of self-destruction for aging cells.</p>
					<p>Autophagy is when double membranes envelope a damaged organelle and the latter combines with lysosomes; the latter digesting the contents and returning molecules to the cytosol.</p>
				<h4>Peroxisomes</h4>
					<p>Membrane-bound organelles involved in lipid synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide is produced to break down fatty and amino acids. Catalase, an enzyme, breaks down hydrogen peroxide for cell digestion.</p>
				<h4>Cytoskeleton</h4>
					<p>Microfilaments act in cytoplasmic streaming, pseudopodia, and cleavage furrow in cell division.</p>
					<p>Microtubules form flagella and cilia. With centrosomes, they affect the miotic spindle in cell division.</p>
					<p>Intermediate filaments position the nucleus and are found in the nuclear lamina.</p>
				<h4>Chloroplasts</h4>
					<p>Responsible for chlorophyll, or green pigment in plants. Essential in photosynthesis, having enzymes and molecules, in plant, algal, and other cells. It is membrane-bound and contains thykaloids, or flattened connected sacs with chlorophyll; stroma, fluid around the thykaloid and storing DNA, ribosomes, and enzymes; and intermediate space.</p>
				<h4>Cytoplasm</h4>
					<p>Is the jelly-like fluid that parts float in, aiding movement and dissolution.</p>

			<h3>THE ENDOSYMBIOTIC THEORY</h3>
			<img class="pic4" src="../images/endo.webp" alt="endosymbiotic theory" height="450px" width="750px">
				<article>
				<p>"Endo" and "symbiotic" meaning "within" and "material," respectively. According to this theory, prokaryotes engulf other prokaryotes in an act of mutualism producing photosynthetic bacteria. The organelles of prokaryotes result in chloroplasts and mitochondria today through macroevolution.</p>
				<h4 id="support">Supporting Facts</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>The DNA of mitochondria and chloroplasts are similar to bacterial DNA</li>
						<li>The sizes of the aforementioned two are similar to those of prokaryotic bacteria.</li>
						<li>Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide as in bacteria.</li>

			<h3>EVOLUTION OF MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS</h3>
			<img class="pic5" src="../images/multicell.jpg" alt="multicellular" height="450px" width="750px">
			<article>
				<h4>Symbiotic Theory</h4>
					<p>Individual eukaryotic cells led dependent symbiotic relationships wherein multicellular species were formed.</p>
				<h4>Syncytial Theory</h4>
					<p>In Hadzi and Hanson's 1963 theory, multinucleated protists with cilia, underwent cell division excluding cytoplasm; forming cell membranes around nuclei, producing multiple cells within an individual.</p>
				<h4>Colonial Theory</h4>
					<p>Haeckel, in 1874, proposed unicellular organisms of the same species formed multicellular species.</p>
				<p id="box">Although volvocine species are alike to ancestors from unicellular to multicellular, multicellularity is essential because of cell size. Smaller single-celled species, with high surface area to volume ratio, have more efficient oxygen diffusion.</p>
