				<h3>TYPES OF PLANT TISSUES</h3>
				<h4>Ground Tissue</h4>
					<p>The most common and dominant tissue in plants, it heals wounds and replaces tissue, such as in traumas, diseases, or infections. It is a photosynthetic layer (mesophyll); an area for gas exchange; and serves for food storage in starch.</p>
				<h4>Dermal Tissue</h4>
					<p>The skin or outermost layer of a plant. Its epidermis is one cell thick and has no chloroplasts; contains a waxy cuticle evolved from Cambrian Explosion for water retention and protection.</p>
				<h4>Vascular</h4>
					<p>Present in vascular species. Not found in nonvascular species such as moss.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
			
			<article>
				<h3>MERISTEMS</h3>
				<h4>Apical Maristems</h4>
					<p>Lengthens and causes primary growth at tips of shoots and roots, producing flowers and leaves.</p>
				<h4>Lateral Meristems</h4>
					<p>Widens and causes secondary growth at carnbium, causing tree barks.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
			
			<article>
				<h3>SIMPLE PERMANENT TISSUES</h3>
				<h4>Parenchyma</h4>
					<p>Has thin cell walls with intracellular air spaces and packages and stores tissue for gaseous exchange and osmosis.</p>
				<h4>Collenchyma</h4>
					<p>Is unevenly thickened but with thick corners, supports with flexible walls and photosynthesizes.</p>
				<h4>Schlerenchyma</h4>
					<p>Has evenly thick walls and functions in strength, such as in barks; with schlereid observed in nuts and stone fruit.</p>
				<h3>COMPLEX PERMANENT TISSUES</h3>
				<h4>Xylem</h4>
					<p>Dead and empty; elongated cells; large lumen; cell walls with lignin; and pits for lateral water movement. Transports water and minerals in a one-way direction.</p>
					<p>Vessels are round and end-to-end; tracheids have spindles and overlap.</p>
				<h4>Phloem</h4>
					<p>End-to-end with sieve plates and companion cells, transporting sugars in two-way direction.</p>

				<h3>EPITHELIAL TISSUES</h3>
				<h4>Squamous</h4>
					<p>Thin and irregularly shaped with large, flattened nucleus, and found in mouth, alveoli, and skin surface.</p>
				<h4>Columnar</h4>
					<p>Elongated cells with oval nucleus with or without cilia, secretes mucus and absorbed digested food, as in intestines or gallbladder.</p>
				<h4>Cuboidal</h4>
					<p>Square shaped with spherical nucleus; absorbs and secretes, as in the sweat gland, thyroid, and kidneys</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
			
			<article>
				<h3>NERVE TISSUE</h3>
				<h4>Sensory Neurone</h4>
					<p>Senses signals</p>
				<h4>Relay neurone (interneuron)</h4>
					<p>Relays information</p>
				<h4>Motor neurone</h4>
					<p>Commands muscles for reaction</p>
				<p>An example involving the three neurones includes reflexively withdrawing one's hand upon touching a hot object.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
			
			<article>
				<h3>CONNECTIVE TISSUE</h3>
				<h4>Areolar</h4>
					<p>Binds epithelium in matrix (or cytoplasm for nucelus) of elastic collagen and fibers, found between skin and organs.</p>
				<h4>Fibrous</h4>
					<p>A dense network of elongated rows of non-elastic collagen, called fibroblasts, in tendons and ligaments.</p>
				<h4>Cartilage</h4>
					<p>Chondrocytes found in matrix; absorbs shock, as in joints, ears, and nose.</p>
				<h4>Blood</h4>
					<p>Consists of Lymphocytes, Erythrocytes, and Platelets; transporting, waste, nutrients, and hormones, in the circulatory system.</p>
				<h4>Adipose</h4>
					<p>Fat cells, for energy storage and insulation, found under skin and around organs</p>
				<h4>Bone</h4>
					<p>Network of systems, osteocyte in solid matter. Structures body and muscle attachment in the skeletal system.</p>
			</article>
			
			<hr>
			
			<article>
				<h3>MUSCLE TISSUE</h3>
				<h4>Skeletal Muscle</h4>
					<p>Striated with multiple nuclei, voluntary, and attached to bones.</p>
				<h4>Smooth Muscle</h4>
					<p>Not striated with thin spindle fibers; involuntary, found in digestive system and blood vessels.</p>
				<h4>Cardiac Muscle</h4>
					<p>Faintly striated; network of branched muscle fibers; involuntary; found in heart.</p>
